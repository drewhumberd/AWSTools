Tools I've created to make my life as an AWS developer/technician a bit easier.

**instance_report.py** - provides a markdown-formatted report on instances in the current region, including name, instance type, AZ, platform, and total storage.

**securitygroups.py** - provides a simple user interface for creating and adding rules to security groups (if you've ever tried to do this at any kind of scale in the console GUI you'll know my pain).

**sgrules.py** - describes all security group rules in a region and outputs to CSV.
